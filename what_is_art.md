# What is Art?

A long time ago I was told that the creator of the game Ico said that games aren't art. Looking into it more, I think that was a mis-paraphrase further muddled by context and language issues. But I then found that Roger Ebert said that games aren't art.

But then I guess he later recanted... but anyway, a long time ago when I heard about the Ico creator, I wanted to argue back and say games _are_ art, but I couldn't do that without a definition for art.

A clear definition for art can help clarify and move debates forward about art (what is and isn't art: sampling, AI, plagiarism). It can help people who want to make art but are experiencing deep gestalt decomposition. It could help in discussions and developing policy for protecting art: for instance, is a selfie taken by a monkey art? And maybe other things?

Wikipedia says

> The conscious production or arrangement of sounds, colours, forms, movements, or other elements in a manner that affects the senses and emotions

I.e. the production of things that affect people. But a bog standard lightbulb manufacturer would be an art powerhouse by this definition.

Cambridge

> the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings

I don't think objects can express feelings, but maybe they can cause people to experience feelings? Even then, the sound of chalk on a chalkboard (the unpleasant one) cause people a rather unpleasant feeling, but is probably not art.

Merriam Webster

> the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects

Is a financial analyst actually an artist? Because they consciouslly use skill. If you ignore "especially" I think Manzoni would be disqualified.

Oxford

> the use of the imagination to express ideas or feelings....

I actually like this one the best, but it's again floppy. If someone dumps a bottle of canola oil on you because they're angry with you I'd say they came up with a new (imaginative) way to express their anger (feelings), but I wouldn't say that's art.

Art is varied and vast, which makes it hard to define, but I don't think these definitions are tight enough to reason from. My idea here is to come up with a definition based on things that are uncontroversially art and not-art, and then use the definition to argue about more ambiguous cases.

## What is art?

Art is: an idea, and the communication of that idea.

This is pretty similar to the Oxford definition but it leaves out the feeling bit.

The two parts are important. If you have an idea but never tell it to anyone, it's not communicated so it's not art (yet). If you turn on the radio and get noise, no idea has been communicated so it's not art. There can of course be ideas in the communication of an idea, like how you expose shots in a film, or the style in which you illustrate a book.

But what's an idea then (as used in this context)? I believe an idea is: new, relevant information of a possibility. It's possible for a house to shine in this color in these weather conditions, at this time, in this sort of a location; it's possible for a murderer to blind a detective in this way; it's possible for a human to play this many instruments.

It's important to differentiate ideas from information. 2+2=4 is information, but not an idea. A report that X was elected is not art. I don't have any negative examples, but science fiction and fantasy communicate the idea of how life and society could be (a possibility) in the future, or if physics were somehow different. Lyrics in a song communicate new ways words can be used together, or a new way to convey the idea of "love" or some shade of that.

The use of "possibility" in the definition of idea ties back into the "communication" concept as well. If you want to produce an artwork about a murderer who blinds a detective in some way, but fail to communicate (read: convince) this to the reader, you have not produced art. It'd be like some kid reading a comic then relaying it to you: "the hero punches the bad guy at the speed of light and then teleports through a wall to catch the bomb and disables it and saves the day". The original comic may have communicated this with logic and details (enough to suspend disbelief), but from the kid it sounds thoroughly unbelievable.

The "new" part means that receiving the same information multiple times, only the first time is it an idea. If you've already seen an artist playing 10 instruments, if you see another artist playing 10 instruments it's no longer an idea.

Relevance means, for example, if you don't have the knowledge or circumstances to make use of a possibility, it's also not an idea to you. If someone with neither interest nor knowledge of mechanics is told that it's possible to make a brushless electric motor, this isn't an idea to them.

Anyways, I think this definition generally includes paintings, music, TV. This generally excludes lightbulb manufacturing and routine financial analysis.

There's an implicit idea in most art that "a human is capable of creating art like this". This implicit idea is referenced in several discussions below.

## The implications!

### We like art because we like ideas!

I have nothing else to add here.

### Art is relative, artistic merit is a scale

By the definition of idea, the same information of a possibility may not be new or relevant to everyone. This means that a given work might not be art to everyone. Math haiku on a university department blackboard are going to be art to fewer people than haiku about the weather.

It takes time to internalize an idea. You can watch the same movie several times with excitement, but at some point you know the contents so well you do not experience it the same way. You may still enjoy the work - for nostalgia, because you associate it with memories, as a social event - but it is no longer artwork to you. For complex works, you may internalize some ideas in a work while discovering new ones making it an artwork longer, but in different ways.

Between these two things, works have a scale of artistic merit: some works may communicate to you no ideas and therefore have no "artistic merit", some may have a few ideas that appeal to you, and others may be incredibly full of ideas and have extremely great artistic merit. To one person a work may have only a few ideas and therefore have low artistic merit while to someone else have many ideas and have great artistic merit.

People are empathetic so even if someone does not personally consider a work art, they are aware of others' circumstances and may be able to recognize that others would consider the work art based on that, or remember that they thought something was art in the past.

### Style

Many artists work hard to develop a "style". A style is typically a recognizable feature - a repeated idea, a way of doing things, shapes, ticks, etc. As such, a style is not an idea in subsequent works and therefore doesn't necessarily contribute to the artistic merit of those works.

Some artists will reinvent themselves. Bands will split, and solo artists will do collaborations with other artists or publish under different names.

### Video games, engineering

Video games are art - they communicate many ideas, effectively.

Engineering would also be art under this definition. While not as universally appreciated, many people collect old cars like others do paintings: original Volkswagon Bugs, Model-T Ford, so on and so forth. There are even many people who display reproductions of patent diagrams on their walls.

### Science, math

This was the most abstract to me, but going by the definition I think the answer should be yes. Metaphorically, coming up with a creative proof or answer to a scientific problem (gravity, evolution, relativity) seems similar to creative solutions to engineering or design problems. And I don't think it would be strange to see one described as a work of art (regardless of whether that's meant metaphorically).

### Photography

A photo of a mountain can be taken to convey a specific idea: a unique feeling of smallness/largeness or distance, for instance. You might control framing, juxtaposition of objects with the mountain, wait for specific weather, use certain film and exposure to effectively communicate this. In this case I think a photo is clearly art.

There's a large amount of photography too where the photographer also creates the scene being photographed: food, props, lighting, and makeup. In this case as well I think a photo is also clearly art.

I think bird photography, on the other hand, generally isn't art. It communicates that a certain type of bird existed at a certain location and time, and that the photographer was able to spy and document this. The excitement of bird photography is in the elusivity of the birds being documented which works against communicating any ideas by setting up shots, framing, posing, so on and so forth.

#### Monkey selfies

I'd guess the monkey was curious and was just grabbing things and accidentally took the photo. There was no particular idea.

However, if the photographer prepared the camera with the idea of "what would it look like if a monkey took a selfie" and lured the monkey into taking the photo, maybe doing multiple takes, that's a clear idea and I think it was communicated clearly so it would be art (even if that explanation were provided ex post facto).

### Sampling, remixing, plagiarism

I listen to a lot of Touhou arrangements. Touhou is a video game series with a widely appreciated soundtrack that has relatively simple production. Numerous artists year after year release albums remixing and arranging this work. I've purchased dozens of such albums, and probably have 10 arrangements of some of the original songs. Each of these have enough artistic merit to me for me to purchase them, sometimes for large amounts of money.

The key thing here is I knew the source material before I first experienced these arrangements. How the arrangements manage to use the source material while transforming it in a way that is, while still clearly recognizable, fresh and non-obvious is an idea that is more relevant to me than the source material itself. Because I know the original work I'm able to see just how creative the reinterpretation is.

In some cases (like when the source material is very well known), the same can be said for sampling.

However, when the source material is hidden or not known to the listener, an opposite effect can occur. Specifically, suppose a poorly produced work samples another work. I hear the poor work first and I don't enjoy it. Then, later, I may hear the original work, but the artistic merit is reduced because I've already experienced some of the key ideas in the poorly made sampling work. I experience little artistic merit from the poorly made work, and less from the original, and therefore less artistic merit overall.

This can happen retroactively too: if a sample is a defining feature of a song, and then I hear numerous other songs with the same sample, I may tire of the sample and be unable to enjoy the work I experienced first.

Often in video game soundtracks, there may be a track with an iconic sound or rhythm section from a commercial sample pack. And later I'll hear another soundtrack with a song that uses the same sample, because it's a good sample. But now I recognize that the parts other than the sample in the two tracks were unimpressive (no ideas specific to those songs), and the sample doesn't stand alone either (it's just drums, or some ambient effect), so to me there's overall less art.

I think the above generally applies to plagiarism as well.

What if the plagiarized work is better than the original? I think, directly speaking, that it would have more artistic merit! However:

- Mentioned in the definition, in many works I think there's an implicit idea that "a single person is capable of coming up with this idea". Finding out that multiple people worked on it, later, means that "a single person is not capable of coming up with this idea", reducing the artistic merit.

  The idea could also be "the person who made another, related, or maybe significantly different work, also made this work." The misattribution deprives the viewer of this idea as well. Knowing about other works may contextualize ideas in this work, or highlight subtle new ideas that may not be visible otherwise.

  Knowing who made a piece of art is very important to many people, I think related to this implicit idea. They may look up the attributed artist to find more art with similar qualities and be disappointed.

  This is the most direct argument.

- I think that for a plagiarized work to be better than the original the plagiarist would have to both understand the idea and its surroundings better than the original artist as well as communicate those. People are different, and have different circumstances and situations - I don't think this is possible. Most plagiarists dilute the original idea with unrelated ideas from their own headspace.

- A plagiarst could contribute a great idea relative to a mediocre source work, but this may not be possible to recognize unless you know the source material.

I think plagiarism is bad for many reasons other than those stated here: created inefficiencies, deprivation of free will, coloring of an artist's other non-plagiarized works due to loss of trust, but since they aren't directly related to the topic here I won't go into detail.

### Classical music performances

While there's a lot of classical music, it is finite and some is more popular than others. If you've been to several classical music performance, you'll probably hear the same pieces multiple times.

Like remixing, what people listen for in many classical performances is creative reinterpretation. The word "interpretation" is frequently used.

A pure reproduction with no interpretation would not be art (or at least, it wouldn't be art separate from the original piece).

### AI art

Generally speaking, AI creates works that are an interpolation of existing art. Therefore, if there _is_ an idea in a piece of AI artwork, that idea is essentially just the prompt -- but AI art is art.

I think the reason so many people don't want to accept AI art as art is that most AI art has very short (or idea-less; not new or relevant) prompts. Taking the recent Ghibli AI art trend as an example, the style of the art contains no ideas: the Ghibli style was created by Ghibli and most people are already familiar with it, and the AI generated art contains no new ideas within the style. Then the prompt is typically something like "me walking down a street with my coworker", which is neither unique nor relevant.

#### Practice and the development of ideas

I'm going to go on a tangent here. I (and a lot of people, I think) want to learn to play instruments, but balk at the idea of spending years learning how to play any specific instrument. What if there were a way to learn to be a guitar virtuoso in a week - couldn't I jump straight to producing songs and become a star?

What many people don't realize that practice is much more than just making neural connections between a sound and a body movement. A huge part of practice is also _experimentation_ and _exploration_ - before you figure out just the right volume, fingering, plucking motion for a sound you try hundreds if not thousands of combinations. Some of these combinations may be useful in creative situations. Through practicing hundreds of songs with hundreds of phrases, movements, etc. you may go through millions of possible playing techniques and even develop some unique ones further. This isn't just knowing the combinations, but recognizing that plucking, fingering, and volume themselves are important parameters that can communicate vastly different ideas.

Many musicians will tell you that learning to read sheet music and play notes accurately is only a small part of learning to play an instrument. There are people who can learn to play an instrument very quickly, but in these cases I think they've already gone through much of this exploration with another instrument, or by doing some activity similar to music performance, and can transfer some of this learning to the new instrument. They haven't just skipped unnecessary work.

The exploration allows you to know what sorts of ideas work well with other ideas, or work against ideas. When you end up producing a work, you can draw on these to layer ideas and produce art that is thick and dense with artistic merit.

In the visual arts, the artist Tao ilustrates scenes filled with toys, food, furniture, decorations, people, living beings, and much more, all warmly inviting and vibrant (that is, enhancing the themes in the piece and expanding the world). I tried to illustrate an album cover with a number of shelves filled with stuff... not mimicking Tao but with a similar idea. I ran out of ideas before half the shelves were filled. This was the first art of the sort I had attempted.

Even in very rough works, the scribbles, blobs representing people, dashes of color, have a consistency that arises from experience that will lead people to consistently visualize things that aren't there. The unfilled lillies in Monet's work imply pooled water, the greens and purples in the pond could be aquatic plants, reflections of flowers, or the sunset sky. They are not detail, but they imply detail through consistency. They support or twist ideas elsewhere in the work.

So returning to AI art, in most work by aritsts who have primarily worked with AI, that sort of detail and deep layering ideas is either not present or a cacaphony that actively detracts from the work. Unless you tell the AI what you're going for, the AI doesn't know to add that stuff. And as a picture is worth 1000 words, it likely won't know without a significant amount of writing.

Furthermore, many AI artists don't recognize this lack of depth or detail consciously because they skipped the process of filling in the work. Dashes of color in the water can imply someone out of frame on the opposite shore - AI wouldn't be able to add this detail without you telling it, and an AI artist wouldn't realize that's a detail that's missing. And even if they did realize, I don't think they would be able to provide instruction to fill this in.

Of course, if an AI artist provides all that detail to the AI - all the ideas a traditional artist would produce in the N hours they spent painting - and it doesn't exceed the prompt/context limit, I don't think anyone would object to calling that art. I think at that point most artists would probably think it's simpler to just use painting software instead of trying to communicate it all via prompt.

I think the apocryphal story of Picasso making a quick drawing on a napkin and demanding millions of Francs is relevant here.

#### Trust and undisclosed AI art

Similar to the arguments about plagiarised art (also, forgeries) the risk of works of hidden methodology and origin is that you will, at some point, realize that the work has little artistic merit.

Appreciating the artistic merit is directly linked to understanding the ideas in a work, and this can take time. We use signs of effort and education (brush technique, accurate instrument playing, quality of film exposure, etc) as a proxy for the density of ideas in a work.

AI art mimicks these signs without the accompanying density of ideas. You see an AI artwork, and recognize the signs of an idea-dense work, and are drawn in. But when you start to dig into it, you realize the work is idea-sparse and you've wasted your time, and maybe other people's time too.

For this reason many people now take signs of AI generation as a negative signal, regardless of the actual artistic merit of the work.

Maybe it's best that these proxies have been devalued, but because finding works of significant artistic merit takes time otherwise without replacement proxies it will make things overall more difficult.

#### The future

I wrote the above on the current state of AI. I think AI will continue to improve.

I don't believe it will be possible for AI to know, without communication, what an artist is trying to communicate any more than another human would. AI may get better at producing consistent or non-misshapen background details for instance, but it won't have _ideas_ (that enhance the artistic merit of the work) for background details because the artist didn't give it any.

Maybe an advance in AI could allow AI to extrapolate new, relevant (based on lifestyles, news, historic fact) ideas (a central theme, supporting details, etc) rather than interpolating other ideas, and produce the work entirely on its own, skipping the need for communication. While this would lack ideas about human potential to create such works I think they could still be works of significant artistic merit.

### Nature

Mountains, flowers, clouds, etc. don't typically communicate any clear idea. People may read ideas from nature they experience, but I think those ideas are obvious or widely shared, so I don't think nature is generally art itself. If you asked 5 people what the idea behind Mount Everest was, or what Mount Everest means to them, I think you'd get five different answers.

If we were in Nepal, looking at Mount Everest, and you said to me "The idea of Everest is the limit of purely human physical capacity" - that statement, plus the view we shared, might be art.

I was also wondering if I should add something about "arising from humans" or "sapience" to the definition of "idea", but I couldn't think of a good way to word it.

### Baby art

Babies and young children may have ideas, but are unable to communicate these via their art. The ideas parents see in these works are generally their own delusions. This is also why nobody other than the parents themselves appreciate the artistic merit of such works.
